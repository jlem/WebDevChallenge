# WebDevChallenge
> A hopefully ever-growing list of web-development related challenges
***

## Guidelines for writing challenges
* 1. Don't be too vague, but don't be too specific. Make the challenge itself specific and measurable, but try not to impose a language or framework.
* 2. If you do want to create a framework/language specific challenge, try to focus on challenges that are unique to that framework/language.
* 3. Avoid "learn XYZ" style challenges - focus on challenges that can be DONE or shown in a git repo.
* 4. Favor challenges that will teach a new, useful skill that is relevant to web development, or skills that teach devs how to solve real web dev problems. The challenge can be a fun, meaningless exercise, but its purpose should be to expose the developer to skills that are applicable to daily web dev tasks.
